# Adaptive-U-stats

### simulation: 
This folder contains codes for conducting one simulation setting in the paper with p=1000. 

- sim1_p1000a2.R contains codes for simulating data and computing p-values.
- The function pcalc.Utest() resturns p-values of finite-order Ustats in one simulation repetition.
- The function inf.test() returns the p-value of U(inf). 

### data: 
This folder contains codes for conducting data analysis of ADNI in the paper. We cannot share the ADNI data as it requires application of access: https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/
